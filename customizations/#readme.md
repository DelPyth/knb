# What is this?
A folder that contains customizations to the HUD.

# How do I use this?
For files that have a hash (#) at the beginning, you only need to open them in notepad or something to change what you want.
Those files in which do not have a hash (#) at the beginning can be moved into `#enabled` as you desire.

# Do you have X?
I may add more features as time goes on, for now this is what it is.
